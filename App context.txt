### Context

Build a **batch image resizer/compressor app for mobile photographers who need to quickly process multiple photos before uploading to social media or sending via messaging apps.

### Non-negotiables

- **Live deployed app** on public URL (Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages)
- **Core functionality:**
    - Upload multiple images at once (drag-and-drop + file picker)
    - Resize to preset dimensions (Instagram: 1080x1080, Story: 1080x1920, Twitter: 1200x675)
    - Compress images (adjustable quality slider: 60-100%)
    - Download all processed images as ZIP
- **Must work on mobile browsers** - test on actual phone
- Must include a lightweight backend or serverless API that handles image upload, resizing, and compression, returning the optimized image along with JSON metrics (originalSize, newSize).
